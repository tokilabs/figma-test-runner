# TS Test Runner: Features

**Human:**
Write a test runner in typescript that has the following features: - Tests can be grouped into suites - Suites can contain other suites - Each suite defines an execution context - A suite execution context is isolated from other suites - A suite execution context is inherited by child suits - Assertions are NOT part of the runner. Libraries like Chai, Should, or Expect JS must be used - In an execution context a call to the function \`fail(message: string)\` fails that test - Failures and successes are recorded and totalized at each level - The runner returns a hierarchical TestRunResult with the recorded data - Suites and tests that have the same parent should run in parallel (by default) using web workers - The following modifiers can be used when creating a suite: - sequence: runs child suites or tests in order - story: runs child suites or tests in order and stop at first failed test or suite - The following modifiers are available for suites and tests: - skip: does not execute suite / test - timeout(number): overrides the default timeout - The runner must differentiate between 'assertion' and 'exception' failures - No exception should escape the runner and must instead be recorded as a failure of the suite or test where it was thrown - A single test result must contain at least the properties: name, scope (the parent suite), outcome - The failure information should contain the properties: expected, actual, context (object containing context variables except for the ones created by the runner)

***

**Assistant:**
Certainly, let's design and implement the TypeScript test runner with the specified features. Due to the complexity of the project, we will proceed in stages.

### Stage 1: Define Basic Structures and Interfaces

1.  **Test**: The basic unit of testing. It will contain properties like name, scope, outcome, and failure information.
2.  **Suite**: A collection of tests and potentially other suites. It will have properties to define its execution context, children, and behavior.
3.  **Modifiers**: Various flags and values that can affect the behavior of a suite or test.
4.  **TestRunResult**: The hierarchical result of running a suite, containing successes, failures, and other statistics.
5.  **ExecutionContext**: The context in which a suite runs, containing any necessary data or functions.

### Stage 2: Implement Basic Functionality

1.  **Creating Suites and Tests**: Functions to create and organize suites and tests.
2.  **Running Tests**: Executing the tests and collecting the results.
3.  **Applying Modifiers**: Handling different behaviors like skipping or timeouts.
4.  **Isolation and Inheritance of Context**: Ensuring that each suite's execution context is isolated and properly inherited by child suites.

### Stage 3: Advanced Features

1.  **Parallel Execution**: Implementing parallel execution using web workers.
2.  **Handling Exceptions and Failures**: Recording assertion and exception failures and differentiating between them.
3.  **Additional Modifiers**: Implementing sequence and story modifiers.

We'll start with Stage 1 by defining the basic structures and interfaces. Are you ready to proceed?

***

**Human:**
yes

***

**Assistant:**
Great! Let's begin by defining the basic structures and interfaces.

### 1\. Test

A test will contain information about its name, scope (parent suite), outcome, and potential failure information.

### 2\. Suite

A suite is a grouping of tests and potentially other suites. It defines its execution context and has various modifiers to control its behavior.

### 3\. Modifiers

Modifiers are used to adjust the behavior of suites and tests.

### 4\. TestRunResult

The result of running a suite or test, containing successes, failures, and other statistical information.

### 5\. ExecutionContext

The context in which a suite runs, with potential additional variables or functions.

Let's code these structures:

```typescript
// Modifiers for suite and test
interface Modifiers {
  skip?: boolean;
  timeout?: number;
  sequence?: boolean;
  story?: boolean;
}

// Failure information
interface FailureInfo {
  expected: any;
  actual: any;
  context: object;
}

// Outcome of a test
type Outcome = 'success' | 'failure-assertion' | 'failure-exception';

// Single test structure
interface Test {
  name: string;
  scope: Suite;
  outcome?: Outcome;
  failure?: FailureInfo;
}

// Suite structure
interface Suite {
  name: string;
  tests: Test[];
  suites: Suite[];
  context: ExecutionContext;
  modifiers: Modifiers;
}

// Execution context
interface ExecutionContext {
  fail(message: string): void;
  [key: string]: any; // Additional context variables
}

// Test run result
interface TestRunResult {
  name: string;
  successes: number;
  failures: number;
  children: TestRunResult[];
}
```

These are the foundational structures that will be used to build the test runner. Next, we'll proceed to Stage 2 to implement the core functionality of creating, organizing, and running tests.

Shall we continue?

***

**Human:**
Before we continue, do we need to modify the types so that modifiers are functions of the \`test\` and \`suite\` declaration functions? e.g. to make a \`suite('the suite name', definitionFunction)\` run in sequence we'd use \`suite.sequence('the suite name', definitionFunction)\`, to skip a test, \`test.skip(...)\`, etc

***

**Assistant:**
Certainly! Modifying the types to allow chaining of modifier functions is a common and expressive way to configure tests and suites. We can define the functions for both tests and suites that allow chaining modifiers like `sequence`, `skip`, `timeout`, etc.

Here's how we might structure the `suite` and `test` declaration functions with such modifiers:

```typescript
type TestFunction = (context: ExecutionContext) => void;

class TestRunner {
  static test(name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): TestRunner;
  static test.skip(name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): TestRunner;
  static test.timeout(ms: number, name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): TestRunner;

  static suite(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): TestRunner;
  static suite.sequence(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): TestRunner;
  static suite.story(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): TestRunner;
  static suite.skip(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): TestRunner;
}

class SuiteRunner {
  test(name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): SuiteRunner;
  test.skip(name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): SuiteRunner;
  test.timeout(ms: number, name: string, testFunction: TestFunction): SuiteRunner;

  suite(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): SuiteRunner;
  suite.sequence(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): SuiteRunner;
  suite.story(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): SuiteRunner;
  suite.skip(name: string, definitionFunction: (suite: SuiteRunner) => void): SuiteRunner;
}
```

Here, we define two classes: `TestRunner` and `SuiteRunner`. The `TestRunner` class is used to define top-level tests and suites, while the `SuiteRunner` class is used within suite definitions to define nested tests and suites.

These classes allow for a fluent API where modifiers can be chained, as shown in your examples.

Does this structure look good, or would you like to make any adjustments before we continue?

***

**Human:**
What do you think about the following type structure? \`\`\` interface RunnableFunction { (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner | TestRunner): void; async (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner): Promise; } interface RunnableUnit { options: { skip: boolean; timeout: number; } (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void; skip: (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => void; timeout: (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => void; } interface RunnableSet extends RunnableUnit { options: RunnableUnit\['options'\] & { sequence: boolean; story: boolean; } sequence: (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => void; story: (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => void; } declare const suite: RunnableSet; declare const test: RunnableUnit; \`\`\`

***

**Assistant:**
The type structure you've proposed is quite elegant and encapsulates the functionality well. It differentiates between suites and tests through the `RunnableSet` and `RunnableUnit` interfaces, and allows for chaining modifiers as functions.

Here's a brief breakdown:

*   **RunnableFunction**: Defines the function signature for both synchronous and asynchronous runnable units (tests and suites).
*   **RunnableUnit**: Represents a general runnable unit (a test) with options for `skip` and `timeout`.
*   **RunnableSet**: Extends `RunnableUnit` to include suite-specific options like `sequence` and `story`.
*   **suite** and **test**: These are the actual declarations that will be used to define tests and suites, adhering to the above interfaces.

This structure allows for clear differentiation between suite-specific and general modifiers, and provides a clean interface for defining and modifying tests and suites.

I think this structure is excellent, and it will support the features and functionality you've described. Are you ready to proceed with the implementation based on this structure?

***

**Human:**
yes

***

**Assistant:**
Great! Let's start implementing the functionality based on the structure you've provided. We'll proceed in stages to make the implementation clear and manageable.

### Stage 2.1: Creating Suites and Tests

We'll begin by implementing functions to create suites and tests, taking into account the modifiers like `skip`, `timeout`, `sequence`, and `story`.

#### Implementing the RunnableUnit and RunnableSet

We'll create the `RunnableUnit` and `RunnableSet` interfaces to represent tests and suites, and then we'll implement the functionality to declare them.

```typescript
interface ExecutionContext {
  fail(message: string): void;
  [key: string]: any;
}

interface RunnableFunction {
  (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner | TestRunner): void;
  async (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner): Promise<void>;
}

interface RunnableUnit {
  options: {
    skip: boolean;
    timeout: number;
  };

  (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void;

  skip(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void;
  timeout(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void;
}

interface RunnableSet extends RunnableUnit {
  options: RunnableUnit['options'] & {
    sequence: boolean;
    story: boolean;
  };

  sequence(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void;
  story(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void;
}

// Implementation of test
const test: RunnableUnit = {
  options: {
    skip: false,
    timeout: 0,
  },
  // TODO: Implement functionality for creating a test
  skip(name, definitionFunction) {
    // TODO: Implement skip modifier
  },
  timeout(name, definitionFunction) {
    // TODO: Implement timeout modifier
  },
};

// Implementation of suite
const suite: RunnableSet = {
  ...test,
  options: {
    ...test.options,
    sequence: false,
    story: false,
  },
  sequence(name, definitionFunction) {
    // TODO: Implement sequence modifier
  },
  story(name, definitionFunction) {
    // TODO: Implement story modifier
  },
};

// Examples
suite('My Suite', (context, runner) => {
  runner.test('My Test', (context) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

suite.sequence('My Sequential Suite', (context, runner) => {
  // Suite implementation
});
```

Here, we've defined the basic structure for creating suites and tests and provided placeholder comments for the implementation.

Next, we'll move to implementing the logic for running tests, handling execution contexts, and applying modifiers.

Would you like to proceed, or do you have any adjustments or specific requests for this part of the implementation?

***

**Human:**
\`test\` and \`suite\` must be functions, as defined by the callable specification in \`interface RunnableUnit { (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void; }\`. Also, I think the modifier functions can be generalized. All that a modifier function does is: - set the option with the matching name to true - call the function I mentioned above, forwarding the arguments

***

**Assistant:**
Certainly! We can modify the `test` and `suite` definitions to be functions, and then generalize the modifier functions to set the appropriate option and forward the arguments.

Here's the updated implementation:

```typescript
type Modifiers = 'skip' | 'timeout' | 'sequence' | 'story';

interface ExecutionContext {
  fail(message: string): void;
  [key: string]: any;
}

interface RunnableFunction {
  (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner | TestRunner): void;
  async (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner): Promise<void>;
}

const createRunnableUnit = (modifiers: Modifiers[]): RunnableUnit => ({
  options: {
    skip: false,
    timeout: 0,
  },
  (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void {
    // TODO: Implement functionality for creating a runnable unit (test or suite)
  },
  ...modifiers.reduce((obj, modifier) => {
    obj[modifier] = (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => {
      this.options[modifier] = true;
      this(name, definitionFunction);
    };
    return obj;
  }, {} as Partial<RunnableUnit>)
});

const test: RunnableUnit = createRunnableUnit(['skip', 'timeout']);

const suite: RunnableSet = {
  ...createRunnableUnit(['skip', 'timeout', 'sequence', 'story']),
  options: {
    ...test.options,
    sequence: false,
    story: false,
  },
};

// Examples
suite('My Suite', (context, runner) => {
  runner.test('My Test', (context) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

suite.sequence('My Sequential Suite', (context, runner) => {
  // Suite implementation
});
```

Here, we've refactored the code to define `test` and `suite` as functions by implementing a `createRunnableUnit` factory function that takes an array of modifiers. This function constructs the `RunnableUnit` object, including the appropriate modifier functions, based on the specified modifiers.

The modifier functions simply set the corresponding option to `true` and then call the main function, forwarding the arguments.

This approach provides a clean and extensible way to define the `test` and `suite` functions with the desired modifiers.

Is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add before we proceed to the next stage?

***

**Human:**
Before we do that, I have two questions: 1. the name\`createRunnableUnit\` is misleading since it can also create runnable sets. what's a better name for it? And let's not use "createRunnableUnitOrSet", please! 2. Do you think we should separate the types for the the Runnable things from the types of the functions that create them (suite and test)?

***

**Assistant:**
1.  **Naming**: A better name could be something that reflects the purpose of the function, which is to create a configurable block of code for testing, whether it's a test or a suite. Since both tests and suites are essentially building blocks for organizing and executing code, we could call it something like `createTestBlock`. This name abstracts away the specific details of whether it's a test or a suite, focusing instead on its role as a building block for testing.
    
2.  **Separating Types**: It might indeed be beneficial to separate the types for the runnable entities (tests and suites) from the types of the functions that create them (`suite` and `test`). This can make the code more maintainable and clear, especially as complexity grows. Separating these concerns provides a clearer distinction between the behavior of tests and suites and the mechanisms used to create and configure them.
    

Here's a revised version taking into account both points:

```typescript
type TestBlockModifiers = 'skip' | 'timeout' | 'sequence' | 'story';

interface TestBlockOptions {
  skip: boolean;
  timeout: number;
  sequence?: boolean;
  story?: boolean;
}

interface RunnableFunction {
  (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner | TestRunner): void;
  async (context: ExecutionContext, runner: SuiteRunner): Promise<void>;
}

const createTestBlock = (modifiers: TestBlockModifiers[], options: TestBlockOptions): RunnableUnit | RunnableSet => ({
  options,
  (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void {
    // TODO: Implement functionality for creating a test block (test or suite)
  },
  ...modifiers.reduce((obj, modifier) => {
    obj[modifier] = (name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction) => {
      this.options[modifier] = true;
      this(name, definitionFunction);
    };
    return obj;
  }, {} as Partial<RunnableUnit | RunnableSet>)
});

const test: RunnableUnit = createTestBlock(['skip', 'timeout'], { skip: false, timeout: 0 });

const suite: RunnableSet = createTestBlock(['skip', 'timeout', 'sequence', 'story'], { skip: false, timeout: 0, sequence: false, story: false });
```

Here, I've renamed the function to `createTestBlock` and introduced a `TestBlockOptions` type to encapsulate the options, allowing for clearer separation between the different concerns.

Let me know if this aligns with your thoughts, or if there are further adjustments you'd like to make!

***

**Human:**
that looks good

***

**Assistant:**
Excellent! With the foundational structure in place, we can now proceed to the next stage.

### Stage 2.2: Running Tests and Handling Execution Contexts

In this stage, we'll implement the logic to run tests, handle execution contexts, and apply modifiers. This involves:

1.  **Running Tests**: Implementing the function to execute a test, recording its outcome.
2.  **Running Suites**: Implementing the function to execute a suite, running its child tests and suites, and recording the results.
3.  **Handling Execution Contexts**: Ensuring that execution contexts are isolated for each suite and inherited by child suites.
4.  **Applying Modifiers**: Applying modifiers like `skip`, `timeout`, `sequence`, and `story` to control the behavior of tests and suites.

Here's a high-level sketch of what we'll be implementing:

1.  **Test Execution Function**: Takes a `Test` object and executes it, recording the result.
    
2.  **Suite Execution Function**: Takes a `Suite` object and executes its child tests and suites according to the specified modifiers. It also manages the execution context for the suite.
    
3.  **Execution Context Handling**: Implementing functionality to create and manage isolated execution contexts for each suite, including inheritance of contexts by child suites.
    
4.  **Modifier Application**: Applying modifiers to tests and suites as they are executed, altering their behavior as specified.
    

This stage involves implementing the core logic of the test runner, so it's a significant step in the development process.

Would you like to proceed with this stage, or do you have any specific requests or questions before we continue?

***

**Human:**
Did you take into account that the user of the test runner will call functions named \`suite\` and \`test\` that only define a title for the suite/test and the function that the runner will have to execute later using. - the \`suite\` will signal the runner to create and register a \`Suite\` - the same goes for \`test\` and \`Test\` - a call to \`suite\` or \`test\` inside another \`suite\` call must register the Suite/Test it creates as a child of the Suite create by the parent \`suite\` call Example: \`\`\`js suite('A', () => { suite('B', () => { test('T', () => {}) }); }); \`\`\` should create a structure like this: \`\`\`js Suite(A) { name: 'A', scope: #ref:TestRunner, suites: \[ Suite(B) { name: 'B', scope: #ref:Suite(A), tests: \[ Test { name: 'T', scope: #ref: Suite(B) } \] } \] } \`\`\` That structuring of suites and tests based on the calls to suite() and test() is a common pattern for test runners. It should be built and stored in the test runner instance to keep track of the hierarchy, before executing the tests.

***

**Assistant:**
Certainly! The hierarchical structure you've described is indeed a common pattern for test runners, and it's essential for organizing and executing tests in a structured way.

We'll need to modify our code to keep track of the current scope and register suites and tests as they are defined. This will involve maintaining a stack-like structure to track the current suite as we nest deeper into the hierarchy.

Here's an outline of how we can approach this:

1.  **Test Runner Class**: A class to encapsulate the entire test runner functionality, including the hierarchy of suites and tests, and the execution logic.
    
2.  **Suite and Test Registration**: Methods within the class to register suites and tests as they are defined, maintaining the correct hierarchical structure.
    
3.  **Scope Management**: Utilizing a stack or similar structure to keep track of the current scope (current suite) as we nest into deeper levels of suites.
    
4.  **Execution**: Methods to execute the entire hierarchy of tests, respecting the structure and modifiers.
    

### Test Runner Class

Here's a skeleton of the `TestRunner` class that includes methods for defining and registering suites and tests:

```typescript
class TestRunner {
  private currentScope: Suite | null = null;
  private rootSuites: Suite[] = [];

  public suite(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void {
    const suite: Suite = {
      name,
      scope: this.currentScope,
      suites: [],
      tests: [],
    };
    if (this.currentScope) {
      this.currentScope.suites.push(suite);
    } else {
      this.rootSuites.push(suite);
    }
    const previousScope = this.currentScope;
    this.currentScope = suite;
    definitionFunction(this.executionContext, this);
    this.currentScope = previousScope;
  }

  public test(name: string, definitionFunction: RunnableFunction): void {
    const test: Test = {
      name,
      scope: this.currentScope,
    };
    if (this.currentScope) {
      this.currentScope.tests.push(test);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Test must be defined within a suite");
    }
    // Optionally, you may execute the definitionFunction here or store it for later execution
  }

  // Additional methods for execution and handling modifiers
}

// Usage
const runner = new TestRunner();
runner.suite('A', () => {
  runner.suite('B', () => {
    runner.test('T', () => { /* Test implementation */ });
  });
});
```

This code sets up the structure you described, maintaining the correct hierarchy of suites and tests. We've added methods for defining suites and tests, and we maintain the current scope as we nest into deeper levels of suites.

Next, we'll need to implement the execution logic, including handling modifiers and execution contexts.

Would you like to proceed with that, or do you have any modifications or questions about this part of the code?

***

**Human:**
yes

***

**Assistant:**
Great! Let's proceed with implementing the execution logic, including handling modifiers and execution contexts.

### Execution Context

We'll first create a method to generate an isolated execution context for each suite, allowing child suites to inherit from the parent context.

### Handling Modifiers

We'll also create methods to handle the modifiers like `skip`, `timeout`, `sequence`, and `story`, applying them to the execution of tests and suites as appropriate.

### Running Tests and Suites

Finally, we'll implement methods to run the tests and suites, respecting the structure, modifiers, and execution contexts.

Here's the updated code:

```typescript
class TestRunner {
  // ... Previous code ...

  private createExecutionContext(parentContext?: ExecutionContext): ExecutionContext {
    return {
      fail: (message: string) => { /* Handle failure */ },
      ...parentContext, // Inherit from parent context
    };
  }

  private runTest(test: Test, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    if (test.options.skip) return; // Handle skip modifier
    // TODO: Implement test execution logic, including handling timeouts
  }

  private runSuite(suite: Suite, context: ExecutionContext): void {
    if (suite.options.skip) return; // Handle skip modifier

    const suiteContext = this.createExecutionContext(context);

    if (suite.options.sequence) {
      // Run child suites and tests in sequence
      for (const childSuite of suite.suites) {
        this.runSuite(childSuite, suiteContext);
      }
      for (const childTest of suite.tests) {
        this.runTest(childTest, suiteContext);
      }
    } else {
      // TODO: Implement parallel execution of child suites and tests
    }

    // TODO: Implement "story" modifier behavior
  }

  public run(): void {
    for (const rootSuite of this.rootSuites) {
      this.runSuite(rootSuite, this.createExecutionContext());
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const runner = new TestRunner();
runner.suite('A', () => {
  runner.suite('B', () => {
    runner.test('T', () => { /* Test implementation */ });
  });
});
runner.run(); // Executes the tests
```

Here, we've implemented the basic structure for executing tests and suites, including creating isolated execution contexts and handling the `skip` and `sequence` modifiers.

The remaining parts to implement include:

*   **Test Execution Logic**: Running the test code, handling timeouts, recording successes and failures.
*   **Parallel Execution**: Running child suites and tests in parallel, as required.
*   **Story Modifier**: Implementing the behavior for the `story` modifier, which stops at the first failure.
*   **Result Collection**: Collecting and returning a hierarchical `TestRunResult` with the recorded data.

Given the complexity, we can continue to build out these parts in subsequent steps. Would you like to proceed with these, or focus on a specific part of the implementation?
